#1.What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
redirect http requests to https in ALB

#2.Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
yeah but someone with access to the attack instance can still access the S3 bucket

#3.Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No this ecnryption will only be applied to new data 

#4.The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
all the manual changes will be lost
