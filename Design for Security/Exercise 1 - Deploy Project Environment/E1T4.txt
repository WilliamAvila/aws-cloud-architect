 #Poor Practices
 1. S3BucketRecipesSecret S3 bucket doesn't have server side encryption enabled
 anyone with access to the account can read this secret data

 2.Web app SG Inbound rules are too open
SSH directly to the server should be disabled and it should only allow requests coming from the ALB
