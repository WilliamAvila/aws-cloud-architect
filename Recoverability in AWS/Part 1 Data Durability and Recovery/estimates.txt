Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 1 - 2 mins or more
RDS automatically switches to the standby replica if Multi AZ is enabled so it will only take 
the failover time which takes like 1 to 2 mins 

Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 10 - 20 mins
When a an RTO for a single region happens it requires the person in charge of monitoring to promote 
the replica on the secondary region and also to update the DB url on the application using it.

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 0 mins
Because we have setup Multi AZ we have a copy of the primary database so it won't be loss of data

Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 0 mins
There won't be no data loss because we have a repplica on another region
